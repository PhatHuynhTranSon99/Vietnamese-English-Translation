# Vietnamese-English-Translation
Neural machine translation from Vietnamese to English using only vanilla seq2seq architecture

## Dataset

## Progress
The project is in an incomplete state, as I haved trained the model but its performance can still be improved by upgrading the architecture.

- [ ] Using Bidirectional encoder-decoder
- [ ] Adding Attention mechanism

## Sample translation
Some translated pairs using the model. It can be seen that the model's performance is still not good yet. Most sentences feel like it can get there but doesn't.

```
tôi phải đi làm sớm vào hôm nay . -> I I to go to work .
chuyến xe hôm nay đến trễ 10 phút . -> My next is is 15 minutes .
anh ta chuẩn bị đáp máy bay xuống sân bay. -> He &apos;s going to fly to fly to fly .
cô ta làm nghề luật sư. -> She did the <unk> .
```
